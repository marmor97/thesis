Question: According to the author, how does the availability of better health care impact running speed? 1) Better health care allows athletes to come back from injuries that would formerly have ended their careers. 2) Disease prevention and good nutrition throughout childhood and young adulthood prevent an accumulation of small, barely noticeable permanent effects left behind by diseases and any periods of malnutrition. 3) Better health care means people have more access to doctors, and more access to doctors means more opportunities for access to performance-enhancing drugs. 4) The author points out that when you are healthy more often, you can train more, thus you get faster..
